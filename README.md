<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Standard and Poorâ€™s Index, also known as the SP500, is an index that analyzes and tracks the stock performances of 500 of the largest companies in the United States (Kenton et al, 2019). Therefore, it is absolutely imperative for stockholders and investors alike to be able to predict expected market performances through using the SP500, in order for investors to be able to beat the market and create portfolios that generate higher than average earnings. 
There are several key factors that affect the SP500 index, namely, the consumer price index, dividends, and the interest rate. Through analyzing historical data of the SP500 from 1871 to today, we developed neural network machine learning models to predict the SP500 index, which can then be used to make business and investment decisions. 
Neural networks utilize hidden layers in between the dependent and the independent variables to predict the values of the independent variables (Pedrogosa et al, 2011). The predicted values can then be compared to actual values in order to determine the accuracy of the program (Pedrogosa et al, 2011).
	The dataset was retrieved from https://datahub.io/core/s-and-p-500-companies, which is a data science website that hosts a variety of different datasets. Once the SP500 dataset has been retrieved, the csv file was processed into 4 text files: 1) sp500.txt, 2) cpi.txt, 3) dividend.txt, and 4) interestrate.txt. The text files were then saved as Mac OS style text files so that it could be read by XCode. Once the data has been adequately preprocessed, they could then be read into the program as matrices.
